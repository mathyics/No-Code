- Controllers (e.g., [`auth_controllers/auth_methods.dart`](ui/lib/controllers/auth_controllers/auth_methods.dart)) manage authentication, user state, and API calls.
- Theming and dark mode support via [`constants/theme.dart`](ui/lib/constants/theme.dart).
- Toasts and error handling via [`Utils/show_toast.dart`](ui/lib/Utils/show_toast.dart).

## Backend (Node.js/Express)

### API Endpoints

- **User Authentication:**  
  - `POST /api/users/register` — Register new users with avatar and cover image upload.
  - `POST /api/users/login` — Login and receive tokens.
  - `POST /api/users/logout` — Logout and invalidate tokens.
  - `POST /api/users/updatePassword` — Change password.
  - `POST /api/users/updateFullName` — Update full name.
  - `POST /api/users/updateUserAvatar` — Update avatar.
  - `POST /api/users/updateUserCoverImage` — Update cover image.


- **AI Integration:**  
  - `POST /api/users/getAPIRes` — Proxy to external AI API for chatbot responses.

- **Video Content:**  
  - `POST /api/videos/create` — Upload videos with thumbnail and hashtags.
  - `GET /api/videos/` — List videos with pagination.

### Database Models

- **User** ([`_01_user.model.js`](server/src/models/_01_user.model.js)):  
  Stores user info, avatar, cover image, watch history, password (hashed), and tokens.

- **Video** ([`_02_video.model.js`](server/src/models/_02_video.model.js)):  
  Stores video file URL, thumbnail, title, description, duration, views, owner, hashtags.

- **Subscription** ([`_03_subscription.model.js`](server/src/models/_03_subscription.model.js)):  
  Tracks which user subscribes to which channel.

- **Likes & Comments** ([`_04_likes.model.js`](server/src/models/_04_likes.model.js), [`_05_comment.model.js`](server/src/models/_05_comment.model.js)):  
  For video engagement and feedback.

### File Uploads & Cloudinary

- Uses **Multer** middleware ([`_01_multer.middle_ware.js`](server/src/middleware/_01_multer.middle_ware.js)) for handling file uploads.
- Uploaded files are stored locally and then uploaded to **Cloudinary** ([`_06_cloudinary.file_uploading.util.js`](server/src/Utils/_06_cloudinary.file_uploading.util.js)) for CDN delivery.

---

## Authentication Flow

- **Registration:**  
  User submits form with email, username, password, full name, avatar, and cover image.  
  Backend validates, checks for duplicates, hashes password, uploads images, and stores user.

- **Login:**  
  User submits credentials. Backend verifies, issues JWT access and refresh tokens, and sets cookies.

- **Token Management:**  
  Refresh tokens are stored and validated for session management.

- **Profile Updates:**  
  Users can update their name, password, avatar, and cover image via dedicated endpoints.

---

## How to Run

### Backend

```sh
cd server
npm install
npm start
```
- Configure `.env` with MongoDB, Cloudinary, and CORS settings.

### Frontend

```sh
cd ui
flutter pub get
flutter run
```
- Configure `pubspec.yaml` for assets and dependencies.

---

## Customization & Extensibility

- **Add New Features:**  
  Add new pages in `ui/lib/pages/` and corresponding routes in `constants/routes.dart`.
- **Extend Models:**  
  Update Mongoose schemas in `server/src/models/` and regenerate Dart models if needed.
- **Integrate More AI:**  
  Extend backend AI endpoints or connect to new APIs in [`_01_user.controller.js`](server/src/controller/_01_user.controller.js).
- **Theming:**  
  Customize themes in [`constants/theme.dart`](ui/lib/constants/theme.dart).
